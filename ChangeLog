    - This version detects during ./configure whether to use
      x86 ASM or not - it also comes with a Python FUSE script
      that allows you to mount Reed-Solomon protected filesystems.

    CHANGES from original rsbep: 

    - gravy (autoconf/automake), ...
    - This version doesn't write the 3 parameters of rsbep as a 
      single line before the data, as this makes the stream fragile
      (if this information is lost, decoding fails...)
    - It uses a default value of 16*255=4080 for parameter D, 
      and it can thus tolerate 4080*16=65280 consecutive bytes 
      to be lost anywhere in the stream, and still recover...
    - It comes with two very simple scripts (freeze.sh, melt.sh)
      that keep track of the input size, and thus offer a complete
      interface for standalone file "shielding".
